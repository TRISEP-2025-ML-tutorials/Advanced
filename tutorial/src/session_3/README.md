# Session 3: Presenting Your Results

Congratulations on completing the first two sessions of this tutorial!

In this third and final session, you'll take time to reflect on your work,
choose your best model configuration based on your training outputs, and prepare
a short presentation.

Each group will have:
- **45 minutes** to prepare their presentation.
- **3 minutes** to present their work to the rest of the class.

Your presentation is short, so focus on what you find most interesting or
important. Here are some ideas of what you might want to include:
- A quick overview of your model and any modifications.
- Highlights from your hyperparameter tuning results.
- A challenge you encountered or any insights you gained.
- Suggestions for future improvements.

## Want to Go Further?

If you're curious to keep exploring after the tutorial, here are a few ideas:
- Try predicting the full vertex position: **(x, y, z)** instead of just z.
- Experiment with different architectures, loss functions, or regularization
  techniques.

You're also welcome to check out the repository where the
[actual ALPHA-g model](https://github.com/ALPHA-g-Experiment/reco)
is being developed.

If you find an improvement or bug while playing with this tutorial,
contributions are always welcome!
