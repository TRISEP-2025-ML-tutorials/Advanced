# Optional: Large Dataset

If you’ve completed the main activities and have a specific idea that could
benefit from access to more data, you can optionally use a **larger dataset**
we’ve provided:

```bash
/fast_scratch_1/TRISEP_data/AdvancedTutorial/large_dataset.parquet
```

This version contains **4 million events**, but **we don't recommend using it by
default**. For most learning goals in this tutorial, the smaller dataset is more
than sufficient and will train models much faster. Training on the larger
dataset can take **~30 minutes per epoch**, so it is only recommended if you
have a specific hypothesis or idea that requires more data.
