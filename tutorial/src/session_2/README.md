# Session 2: Understanding and Improving the Model

Now that you've trained your first model, it's time to dig deeper and start
making it better.

You will:
- Break down the architecture of the baseline model.
- Extend it with additional layers.
- Experiment with hyperparameters to improve performance.

This session will help you build intuition for how the model works and how to
improve it.

By the end, you'll have hands-on experience modifying a neural network and
optimizing training.
