# Introduction

This hands-on machine learning tutorial is based on the event reconstruction
challenges of the ALPHA-g experiment at CERN.

Our goal is to predict the position where antihydrogen atoms annihilate, a task
known as **vertex reconstruction**.

Instead of building everything from scratch, you'll start from a fully working
baseline model. This allows us to focus on:
- Understanding the physics and data,
- Exploring the model's design,
- Improve its performance, and
- Experiment with more advanced ideas.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a clear picture of how deep learning
can be applied to real-world problems, and you'll be ready to tackle your own
machine learning projects.
