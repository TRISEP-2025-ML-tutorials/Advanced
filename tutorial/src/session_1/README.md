# Session 1: Getting Started

In this session you'll get hands-on with the dataset and train your first
machine learning model for vertex reconstruction.

You will:
- Explore what the detector data looks like.
- Preprocess point clouds for training and validation.
- Train a working baseline model.

This gives you a full end-to-end view, from raw data to vertex prediction!

By the end, you-ll be ready to start evaluating and improving this model in
Session 2.
