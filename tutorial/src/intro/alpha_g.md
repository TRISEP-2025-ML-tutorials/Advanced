# What is ALPHA-g?

ALPHA-g is an experiment at CERN that seeks to answer a fundamental question:
**does antimatter fall under gravity the same way as matter?**

To investigate this ALPHA-g traps antihydrogen, a neutral antimatter atom made
of an antiproton and a positron, in a magnetic trap. The atom is then released
and allowed to fall. When it annihilates on contact with matter, it produces
several detectable particles.

Our job is to figure out *where* that annihilation happened. This position, the
**vertex**, is key to determine how the antihydrogen moved and whether gravity
influenced it.

The detector records a series of 3D points left by charged particles resulting
from the annihilation. Reconstructing the vertex from these points is what this
tutorial is all about.
