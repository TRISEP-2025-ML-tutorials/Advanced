# Why Machine Learning?

Reconstructing a vertex from a cloud of hit positions is a perfect use case for
machine learning.

Why?
- It avoids the need to **identify and fit individual particle tracks**, which
  can be difficult or ambiguous.
- It can handle **messy or sparse events** where geometry-based methods might
  struggle.
- ML models can be **trained end-to-end** to optimize for the specific
  reconstruction task, and once trained, they're **fast and scalable**.
