All required code is available in the `code/` directory.

## Overview

This workshop introduces participants to a PointNet-based machine learning
approach for the prediction of antihydrogen annihilation positions in the
ALPHA-g experiment.

**Format:** 3 sessions Ã— 1.5 hours each

## Requirements

A **GPU is recommended** for training the models. While training can run on CPU,
it may be significantly slower.
